<h1>THE MARRIAGES<br />
by Henry James</h1>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Won&rsquo;t</span> you stay a
little longer?&rdquo; the hostess asked while she held the
girl&rsquo;s hand and smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early
for every one to go&mdash;it&rsquo;s too absurd.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Churchley inclined her head to one side and looked gracious;
she flourished about her face, in a vaguely protecting sheltering
way, an enormous fan of red feathers.&nbsp; Everything in her
composition, for Adela Chart, was enormous.&nbsp; She had big
eyes, big teeth, big shoulders, big hands, big rings and
bracelets, big jewels of every sort and many of them.&nbsp; The
train of her crimson dress was longer than any other; her house
was huge; her drawing-room, especially now that the company had
left it, looked vast, and it offered to the girl&rsquo;s eyes a
collection of the largest sofas and chairs, pictures, mirrors,
clocks, that she had ever beheld.&nbsp; Was Mrs.
Churchley&rsquo;s fortune also large, to account for so many
immensities?&nbsp; Of this Adela could know nothing, but it
struck her, while she smiled sweetly back at their entertainer,
that she had better try to find out.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchley had at
least a high-hung carriage drawn by the tallest horses, and in
the Row she was to be seen perched on a mighty hunter.&nbsp; She
was high and extensive herself, though not exactly fat; her bones
were big, her limbs were long, and her loud hurrying voice
resembled the bell of a steamboat.&nbsp; While she spoke to his
daughter she had the air of hiding from Colonel Chart, a little
shyly, behind the wide ostrich fan.&nbsp; But Colonel Chart was
not a man to be either ignored or eluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course every one&rsquo;s going on to something
else,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe there are a lot of
things to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are <i>you</i> going?&rdquo; Mrs. Churchley
asked, dropping her fan and turning her bright hard eyes on the
Colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t do that sort of thing!&rdquo;&mdash;he
used a tone of familiar resentment that fell with a certain
effect on his daughter&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; She saw in it that he
thought Mrs. Churchley might have done him a little more
justice.&nbsp; But what made the honest soul suppose her a person
to look to for a perception of fine shades?&nbsp; Indeed the
shade was one it might have been a little difficult to
seize&mdash;the difference between &ldquo;going on&rdquo; and
coming to a dinner of twenty people.&nbsp; The pair were in
mourning; the second year had maintained it for Adela, but the
Colonel hadn&rsquo;t objected to dining with Mrs. Churchley, any
more than he had objected at Easter to going down to the
Millwards&rsquo;, where he had met her and where the girl had her
reasons for believing him to have known he should meet her.&nbsp;
Adela wasn&rsquo;t clear about the occasion of their original
meeting, to which a certain mystery attached.&nbsp; In Mrs.
Churchley&rsquo;s exclamation now there was the fullest
concurrence in Colonel Chart&rsquo;s idea; she didn&rsquo;t say
&ldquo;Ah yes, dear friend, I understand!&rdquo; but this was the
note of sympathy she plainly wished to sound.&nbsp; It
immediately made Adela say to her &ldquo;Surely you must be going
on somewhere yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must have a lot of places,&rdquo; the Colonel
concurred, while his view of her shining raiment had an invidious
directness.&nbsp; Adela could read the tacit implication:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in sorrow, in desolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchley turned away from her at this and just waited
before answering.&nbsp; The red fan was up again, and this time
it sheltered her from Adela.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give
everything up&mdash;for <i>you</i>,&rdquo; were the words that
issued from behind it.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Do</i> stay a
little.&nbsp; I always think this is such a nice hour.&nbsp; One
can really talk,&rdquo; Mrs. Churchley went on.&nbsp; The Colonel
laughed; he said it wasn&rsquo;t fair.&nbsp; But their hostess
pressed his daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do sit down; it&rsquo;s the
only time to have any talk.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl saw her father
sit down, but she wandered away, turning her back and pretending
to look at a picture.&nbsp; She was so far from agreeing with
Mrs. Churchley that it was an hour she particularly
disliked.&nbsp; She was conscious of the queerness, the shyness,
in London, of the gregarious flight of guests after a dinner, the
general <i>sauve qui peut</i> and panic fear of being left with
the host and hostess.&nbsp; But personally she always felt the
contagion, always conformed to the rush.&nbsp; Besides, she knew
herself turn red now, flushed with a conviction that had come
over her and that she wished not to show.</p>
<p>Her father sat down on one of the big sofas with Mrs.
Churchley; fortunately he was also a person with a presence that
could hold its own.&nbsp; Adela didn&rsquo;t care to sit and
watch them while they made love, as she crudely imaged it, and
she cared still less to join in their strange commerce.&nbsp; She
wandered further away, went into another of the bright
&ldquo;handsome,&rdquo; rather nude rooms&mdash;they were like
women dressed for a ball&mdash;where the displaced chairs, at
awkward angles to each other, seemed to retain the attitudes of
bored talkers.&nbsp; Her heart beat as she had seldom known it,
but she continued to make a pretence of looking at the pictures
on the walls and the ornaments on the tables, while she hoped
that, as she preferred it, it would be also the course her father
would like best.&nbsp; She hoped &ldquo;awfully,&rdquo; as she
would have said, that he wouldn&rsquo;t think her rude.&nbsp; She
was a person of courage, and he was a kind, an intensely
good-natured man; nevertheless she went in some fear of
him.&nbsp; At home it had always been a religion with them to be
nice to the people he liked.&nbsp; How, in the old days, her
mother, her incomparable mother, so clever, so unerring, so
perfect, how in the precious days her mother had practised that
art!&nbsp; Oh her mother, her irrecoverable mother!&nbsp; One of
the pictures she was looking at swam before her eyes.&nbsp; Mrs.
Churchley, in the natural course, would have begun immediately to
climb staircases.&nbsp; Adela could see the high bony shoulders
and the long crimson tail and the universal coruscating nod
wriggle their horribly practical way through the rest of the
night.&nbsp; Therefore she <i>must</i> have had her reasons for
detaining them.&nbsp; There were mothers who thought every one
wanted to marry their eldest son, and the girl sought to be clear
as to whether she herself belonged to the class of daughters who
thought every one wanted to marry their father.&nbsp; Her
companions left her alone; and though she didn&rsquo;t want to be
near them it angered her that Mrs. Churchley didn&rsquo;t call
her.&nbsp; That proved she was conscious of the situation.&nbsp;
She would have called her, only Colonel Chart had perhaps
dreadfully murmured &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, love,
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; This proved he also was
conscious.&nbsp; The time was really not long&mdash;ten minutes
at the most elapsed&mdash;when he cried out gaily, pleasantly, as
if with a small jocular reproach, &ldquo;I say, Adela, we must
release this dear lady!&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke of course as if it
had been Adela&rsquo;s fault that they lingered.&nbsp; When they
took leave she gave Mrs. Churchley, without intention and without
defiance, but from the simple sincerity of her pain, a longer
look into the eyes than she had ever given her before.&nbsp; Mrs.
Churchley&rsquo;s onyx pupils reflected the question as distant
dark windows reflect the sunset; they seemed to say: &ldquo;Yes,
I <i>am</i>, if that&rsquo;s what you want to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What made the case worse, what made the girl more sure, was
the silence preserved by her companion in the brougham on their
way home.&nbsp; They rolled along in the June darkness from
Prince&rsquo;s Gate to Seymour Street, each looking out of a
window in conscious prudence; watching but not seeing the hurry
of the London night, the flash of lamps, the quick roll on the
wood of hansoms and other broughams.&nbsp; Adela had expected her
father would say something about Mrs. Churchley; but when he said
nothing it affected her, very oddly, still more as if he had
spoken.&nbsp; In Seymour Street he asked the footman if Mr.
Godfrey had come in, to which the servant replied that he had
come in early and gone straight to his room.&nbsp; Adela had
gathered as much, without saying so, from a lighted window on the
second floor; but she contributed no remark to the
question.&nbsp; At the foot of the stairs her father halted as if
he had something on his mind; but what it amounted to seemed only
the dry &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; with which he presently
ascended.&nbsp; It was the first time since her mother&rsquo;s
death that he had bidden her good-night without kissing
her.&nbsp; They were a kissing family, and after that dire event
the habit had taken a fresh spring.&nbsp; She had left behind her
such a general passion of regret that in kissing each other they
felt themselves a little to be kissing her.&nbsp; Now, as,
standing in the hall, with the stiff watching footman&mdash;she
could have said to him angrily &ldquo;Go
away!&rdquo;&mdash;planted near her, she looked with unspeakable
pain at her father&rsquo;s back while he mounted, the effect was
of his having withheld from another and a still more slighted
cheek the touch of his lips.</p>
<p>He was going to his room, and after a moment she heard his
door close.&nbsp; Then she said to the servant &ldquo;Shut up the
house&rdquo;&mdash;she tried to do everything her mother had
done, to be a little of what she had been, conscious only of
falling woefully short&mdash;and took her own way upstairs.&nbsp;
After she had reached her room she waited, listening, shaken by
the apprehension that she should hear her father come out again
and go up to Godfrey.&nbsp; He would go up to tell him, to have
it over without delay, precisely because it would be so
difficult.&nbsp; She asked herself indeed why he should tell
Godfrey when he hadn&rsquo;t taken the occasion&mdash;their drive
home being an occasion&mdash;to tell herself.&nbsp; However, she
wanted no announcing, no telling; there was such a horrible
clearness in her mind that what she now waited for was only to be
sure her father wouldn&rsquo;t proceed as she had imagined.&nbsp;
At the end of the minutes she saw this particular danger was
over, upon which she came out and made her own way to her
brother.&nbsp; Exactly what she wanted to say to him first, if
their parent counted on the boy&rsquo;s greater indulgence, and
before he could say anything, was: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forgive
him; don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was to go up for an examination, poor lad, and during these
weeks his lamp burned till the small hours.&nbsp; It was for the
Foreign Office, and there was to be some frightful number of
competitors; but Adela had great hopes of him&mdash;she believed
so in his talents and saw with pity how hard he worked.&nbsp;
This would have made her spare him, not trouble his night, his
scanty rest, if anything less dreadful had been at stake.&nbsp;
It was a blessing however that one could count on his coolness,
young as he was&mdash;his bright good-looking discretion, the
thing that already made him half a man of the world.&nbsp;
Moreover he was the one who would care most.&nbsp; If Basil was
the eldest son&mdash;he had as a matter of course gone into the
army and was in India, on the staff, by good luck, of a
governor-general&mdash;it was exactly this that would make him
comparatively indifferent.&nbsp; His life was elsewhere, and his
father and he had been in a measure military comrades, so that he
would be deterred by a certain delicacy from protesting; he
wouldn&rsquo;t have liked any such protest in an affair of
<i>his</i>.&nbsp; Beatrice and Muriel would care, but they were
too young to speak, and this was just why her own responsibility
was so great.</p>
<p>Godfrey was in working-gear&mdash;shirt and trousers and
slippers and a beautiful silk jacket.&nbsp; His room felt hot,
though a window was open to the summer night; the lamp on the
table shed its studious light over a formidable heap of
text-books and papers, the bed moreover showing how he had flung
himself down to think out a problem.&nbsp; As soon as she got in
she began.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s going to marry Mrs.
Churchley, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw his poor pink face turn pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen with my eyes.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been
dining there&mdash;we&rsquo;ve just come home.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
in love with her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s in love with
<i>him</i>.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll arrange it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I say!&rdquo; Godfrey exclaimed, incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, he will, he will!&rdquo; cried the girl; and
with it she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Godfrey, who had a cigarette in his hand, lighted it at one of
the candles on the mantelpiece as if he were embarrassed.&nbsp;
As Adela, who had dropped into his armchair, continued to sob, he
said after a moment: &ldquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to&mdash;he
oughtn&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh think of mamma&mdash;think of mamma!&rdquo; she
wailed almost louder than was safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he ought to think of mamma.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
which Godfrey looked at the tip of his cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To such a woman as that&mdash;after
<i>her</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old mamma!&rdquo; said Godfrey while he
smoked.</p>
<p>Adela rose again, drying her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like an insult to her; it&rsquo;s as if he denied
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now that she spoke of it she felt herself rise
to a height.&nbsp; &ldquo;He rubs out at a stroke all the years
of their happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were awfully happy,&rdquo; Godfrey agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think what she was&mdash;think how no one else will
ever again be like her!&rdquo; the girl went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s not very happy now,&rdquo; her
brother vaguely contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he isn&rsquo;t, any more than you and I are;
and it&rsquo;s dreadful of him to want to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t make yourself miserable till
you&rsquo;re sure,&rdquo; the young man said.</p>
<p>But Adela showed him confidently that she <i>was</i> sure,
from the way the pair had behaved together and from her
father&rsquo;s attitude on the drive home.&nbsp; If Godfrey had
been there he would have seen everything; it couldn&rsquo;t be
explained, but he would have felt.&nbsp; When he asked at what
moment the girl had first had her suspicion she replied that it
had all come at once, that evening; or that at least she had had
no conscious fear till then.&nbsp; There had been signs for two
or three weeks, but she hadn&rsquo;t understood them&mdash;ever
since the day Mrs. Churchley had dined in Seymour Street.&nbsp;
Adela had on that occasion thought it odd her father should have
wished to invite her, given the quiet way they were living; she
was a person they knew so little.&nbsp; He had said something
about her having been very civil to him, and that evening,
already, she had guessed that he must have frequented their
portentous guest herself more than there had been signs of.&nbsp;
To-night it had come to her clearly that he would have called on
her every day since the time of her dining with them; every
afternoon about the hour he was ostensibly at his club.&nbsp;
Mrs. Churchley <i>was</i> his club&mdash;she was for all the
world just like one.&nbsp; At this Godfrey laughed; he wanted to
know what his sister knew about clubs.&nbsp; She was slightly
disappointed in his laugh, even wounded by it, but she knew
perfectly what she meant: she meant that Mrs. Churchley was
public and florid, promiscuous and mannish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I daresay she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said as
if he wanted to get on with his work.&nbsp; He looked at the
clock on the mantel-shelf; he would have to put in another
hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right to come and take darling mamma&rsquo;s
place&mdash;to sit where <i>she</i> used to sit, to lay her
horrible hands on <i>her</i> things?&rdquo;&nbsp; Adela was
appalled&mdash;all the more that she hadn&rsquo;t expected
it&mdash;at her brother&rsquo;s apparent acceptance of such a
prospect.</p>
<p>He coloured; there was something in her passionate piety that
scorched him.&nbsp; She glared at him with tragic eyes&mdash;he
might have profaned an altar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh I mean that nothing
will come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we do our duty,&rdquo; said Adela.&nbsp; And
then as he looked as if he hadn&rsquo;t an idea of what that
could be: &ldquo;You must speak to him&mdash;tell him how we
feel; that we shall never forgive him, that we can&rsquo;t endure
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m cheeky,&rdquo; her brother
returned, looking down at his papers with his back to her and his
hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheeky to plead for <i>her</i> memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s none of my
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe he&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo; cried the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&nbsp; Go to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> speak to him&rdquo;&mdash;she had
turned as pale as a young priestess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry out till you&rsquo;re hurt; wait till
he speaks to <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t, he won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do it without telling
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother had faced round to her again; he started a little
at this, and again, at one of the candles, lighted his cigarette,
which had gone out.&nbsp; She looked at him a moment; then he
said something that surprised her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is Mrs. Churchley
very rich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; What on earth has
that to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godfrey puffed his cigarette.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does she live as if
she were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a lot of hideous showy things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must keep our eyes open,&rdquo; he
concluded.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now you <i>must</i> let me get
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He kissed his visitor as if to make up for
dismissing her, or for his failure to take fire; and she held him
a moment, burying her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>A wave of emotion surged through her, and again she quavered
out: &ldquo;Ah why did she leave us?&nbsp; Why did she leave
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why indeed?&rdquo; the young man sighed,
disengaging himself with a movement of oppression.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Adela</span> was so far right as that by
the end of the week, though she remained certain, her father had
still not made the announcement she dreaded.&nbsp; What convinced
her was the sense of her changed relations with him&mdash;of
there being between them something unexpressed, something she was
aware of as she would have been of an open wound.&nbsp; When she
spoke of this to Godfrey he said the change was of her own
making&mdash;also that she was cruelly unjust to the
governor.&nbsp; She suffered even more from her brother&rsquo;s
unexpected perversity; she had had so different a theory about
him that her disappointment was almost an humiliation and she
needed all her fortitude to pitch her faith lower.&nbsp; She
wondered what had happened to him and why he so failed her.&nbsp;
She would have trusted him to feel right about anything, above
all about such a question.&nbsp; Their worship of their
mother&rsquo;s memory, their recognition of her sacred place in
their past, her exquisite influence in their father&rsquo;s life,
his fortune, his career, in the whole history of the family and
welfare of the house&mdash;accomplished clever gentle good
beautiful and capable as she had been, a woman whose quiet
distinction was universally admired, so that on her death one of
the Princesses, the most august of her friends, had written Adela
such a note about her as princesses were understood very seldom
to write: their hushed tenderness over all this was like a
religion, and was also an attributive honour, to fall away from
which was a form of treachery.&nbsp; This wasn&rsquo;t the way
people usually felt in London, she knew; but strenuous ardent
observant girl as she was, with secrecies of sentiment and dim
originalities of attitude, she had already made up her mind that
London was no treasure-house of delicacies.&nbsp; Remembrance
there was hammered thin&mdash;to be faithful was to make society
gape.&nbsp; The patient dead were sacrificed; they had no
shrines, for people were literally ashamed of mourning.&nbsp;
When they had hustled all sensibility out of their lives they
invented the fiction that they felt too much to utter.&nbsp;
Adela said nothing to her sisters; this reticence was part of the
virtue it was her idea to practise for them.&nbsp; <i>She</i> was
to be their mother, a direct deputy and representative.&nbsp;
Before the vision of that other woman parading in such a
character she felt capable of ingenuities, of deep
diplomacies.&nbsp; The essence of these indeed was just
tremulously to watch her father.&nbsp; Five days after they had
dined together at Mrs. Churchley&rsquo;s he asked her if she had
been to see that lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed, why should I?&rdquo; Adela knew that he knew
she hadn&rsquo;t been, since Mrs. Churchley would have told
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call on people after you dine with
them?&rdquo; said Colonel Chart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in the course of time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t rush
off within the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father looked at her, and his eyes were colder than she
had ever seen them, which was probably, she reflected, just the
way hers appeared to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll
please rush off to-morrow.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s to dine with us on
the 12th, and I shall expect your sisters to come
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adela stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;To a dinner-party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to be a dinner-party.&nbsp; I want them
to know Mrs. Churchley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there to be nobody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Godfrey of course.&nbsp; A family party,&rdquo; he said
with an assurance before which she turned cold.</p>
<p>The girl asked her brother that evening if <i>that</i>
wasn&rsquo;t tantamount to an announcement.&nbsp; He looked at
her queerly and then said: &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve</i> been to see
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth did you do that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father told me he wished it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he <i>has</i> told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told me what?&rdquo; Godfrey asked while her heart sank
with the sense of his making difficulties for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they&rsquo;re engaged, of course.&nbsp; What else
can all this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell me that, but I like
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Like</i> her!&rdquo; the girl shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very kind, very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To thrust herself upon us when we hate her?&nbsp; Is
that what you call kind?&nbsp; Is that what you call
decent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t hate her&rdquo;&mdash;and he
turned away as if she bored him.</p>
<p>She called the next day on Mrs. Churchley, designing to break
out somehow, to plead, to appeal&mdash;&ldquo;Oh spare us! have
mercy on us! let him alone! go away!&rdquo;&nbsp; But that
wasn&rsquo;t easy when they were face to face.&nbsp; Mrs.
Churchley had every intention of getting, as she would have
said&mdash;she was perpetually using the expression&mdash;into
touch; but her good intentions were as depressing as a
tailor&rsquo;s misfits.&nbsp; She could never understand that
they had no place for her vulgar charity, that their life was
filled with a fragrance of perfection for which she had no sense
fine enough.&nbsp; She was as undomestic as a shop-front and as
out of tune as a parrot.&nbsp; She would either make them live in
the streets or bring the streets into their life&mdash;it was the
same thing.&nbsp; She had evidently never read a book, and she
used intonations that Adela had never heard, as if she had been
an Australian or an American.&nbsp; She understood everything in
a vulgar sense; speaking of Godfrey&rsquo;s visit to her and
praising him according to her idea, saying horrid things about
him&mdash;that he was awfully good-looking, a perfect gentleman,
the kind she liked.&nbsp; How could her father, who was after all
in everything else such a dear, listen to a woman, or endure her,
who thought she pleased him when she called the son of his dead
wife a perfect gentleman?&nbsp; What would he have been,
pray?&nbsp; Much she knew about what any of them were! When she
told Adela she wanted her to like her the girl thought for an
instant her opportunity had come&mdash;the chance to plead with
her and beg her off.&nbsp; But she presented such an impenetrable
surface that it would have been like giving a message to a
varnished door.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t a woman, said Adela; she
was an address.</p>
<p>When she dined in Seymour Street the &ldquo;children,&rdquo;
as the girl called the others, including Godfrey, liked
her.&nbsp; Beatrice and Muriel stared shyly and silently at the
wonders of her apparel (she was brutally over-dressed) without of
course guessing the danger that tainted the air.&nbsp; They
supposed her in their innocence to be amusing, and they
didn&rsquo;t know, any more than she did herself, how she
patronised them.&nbsp; When she was upstairs with them after
dinner Adela could see her look round the room at the things she
meant to alter&mdash;their mother&rsquo;s things, not a bit like
her own and not good enough for her.&nbsp; After a quarter of an
hour of this our young lady felt sure she was deciding that
Seymour Street wouldn&rsquo;t do at all, the dear old home that
had done for their mother those twenty years.&nbsp; Was she
plotting to transport them all to her horrible Prince&rsquo;s
Gate?&nbsp; Of one thing at any rate Adela was certain: her
father, at that moment alone in the dining-room with Godfrey,
pretending to drink another glass of wine to make time, was
coming to the point, was telling the news.&nbsp; When they
reappeared they both, to her eyes, looked unnatural: the news had
been told.</p>
<p>She had it from Godfrey before Mrs. Churchley left the house,
when, after a brief interval, he followed her out of the
drawing-room on her taking her sisters to bed.&nbsp; She was
waiting for him at the door of her room.&nbsp; Her father was
then alone with his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>&mdash;the word was
grotesque to Adela; it was already as if the place were her
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say to him?&rdquo; our young woman asked
when her brother had told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he added,
colouring&mdash;the expression of her face was
such&mdash;&ldquo;There was nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that how it strikes you?&rdquo;&mdash;and she stared
at the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me to speak to her,&rdquo; Godfrey went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what hideous sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell her I was glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you?&rdquo; Adela panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I said something.&nbsp; She
kissed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh how <i>could</i> you?&rdquo; shuddered the girl, who
covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says she&rsquo;s very rich,&rdquo; her brother
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that why you kissed her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kiss her.&nbsp; Good-night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the young man, turning his back, went out.</p>
<p>When he had gone Adela locked herself in as with the fear she
should be overtaken or invaded, and during a sleepless feverish
memorable night she took counsel of her uncompromising
spirit.&nbsp; She saw things as they were, in all the indignity
of life.&nbsp; The levity, the mockery, the infidelity, the
ugliness, lay as plain as a map before her; it was a world of
gross practical jokes, a world <i>pour rire</i>; but she cried
about it all the same.&nbsp; The morning dawned early, or rather
it seemed to her there had been no night, nothing but a sickly
creeping day.&nbsp; But by the time she heard the house stirring
again she had determined what to do.&nbsp; When she came down to
the breakfast-room her father was already in his place with
newspapers and letters; and she expected the first words he would
utter to be a rebuke to her for having disappeared the night
before without taking leave of Mrs. Churchley.&nbsp; Then she saw
he wished to be intensely kind, to make every allowance, to
conciliate and console her.&nbsp; He knew she had heard from
Godfrey, and he got up and kissed her.&nbsp; He told her as
quickly as possible, to have it over, stammering a little, with
an &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a piece of news for you that will probably
shock you,&rdquo; yet looking even exaggeratedly grave and rather
pompous, to inspire the respect he didn&rsquo;t deserve.&nbsp;
When he kissed her she melted, she burst into tears.&nbsp; He
held her against him, kissing her again and again, saying
tenderly &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know, I know.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he
didn&rsquo;t know else he couldn&rsquo;t have done it.&nbsp;
Beatrice and Muriel came in, frightened when they saw her crying,
and still more scared when she turned to them with words and an
air that were terrible in their comfortable little lives:
&ldquo;Papa&rsquo;s going to be married; he&rsquo;s going to
marry Mrs. Churchley!&rdquo;&nbsp; After staring a moment and
seeing their father look as strange, on his side, as Adela,
though in a different way, the children also began to cry, so
that when the servants arrived with tea and boiled eggs these
functionaries were greatly embarrassed with their burden, not
knowing whether to come in or hang back.&nbsp; They all scraped
together a decorum, and as soon as the things had been put on
table the Colonel banished the men with a glance.&nbsp; Then he
made a little affectionate speech to Beatrice and Muriel, in
which he described Mrs. Churchley as the kindest, the most
delightful of women, only wanting to make them happy, only
wanting to make <i>him</i> happy, and convinced that he would be
if they were and that they would be if he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do such words mean?&rdquo; Adela asked
herself.&nbsp; She declared privately that they meant nothing,
but she was silent, and every one was silent, on account of the
advent of Miss Flynn the governess, before whom Colonel Chart
preferred not to discuss the situation.&nbsp; Adela recognised on
the spot that if things were to go as he wished his children
would practically never again be alone with him.&nbsp; He would
spend all his time with Mrs. Churchley till they were married,
and then Mrs. Churchley would spend all her time with him.&nbsp;
Adela was ashamed of him, and that was horrible&mdash;all the
more that every one else would be, all his other friends, every
one who had known her mother.&nbsp; But the public dishonour to
that high memory shouldn&rsquo;t be enacted; he shouldn&rsquo;t
do as he wished.</p>
<p>After breakfast her father remarked to her that it would give
him pleasure if in a day or two she would take her sisters to see
their friend, and she replied that he should be obeyed.&nbsp; He
held her hand a moment, looking at her with an argument in his
eyes which presently hardened into sternness.&nbsp; He wanted to
know that she forgave him, but also wanted to assure her that he
expected her to mind what she did, to go straight.&nbsp; She
turned away her eyes; she was indeed ashamed of him.</p>
<p>She waited three days and then conveyed her sisters to the
<i>repaire</i>, as she would have been ready to term it, of the
lioness.&nbsp; That queen of beasts was surrounded with callers,
as Adela knew she would be; it was her &ldquo;day&rdquo; and the
occasion the girl preferred.&nbsp; Before this she had spent all
her time with her companions, talking to them about their mother,
playing on their memory of her, making them cry and making them
laugh, reminding them of blest hours of their early childhood,
telling them anecdotes of her own.&nbsp; None the less she
confided to them that she believed there was no harm at all in
Mrs. Churchley, and that when the time should come she would
probably take them out immensely.&nbsp; She saw with smothered
irritation that they enjoyed their visit at Prince&rsquo;s Gate;
they had never been at anything so &ldquo;grown-up,&rdquo; nor
seen so many smart bonnets and brilliant complexions.&nbsp;
Moreover they were considered with interest, quite as if, being
minor elements, yet perceptible ones, of Mrs. Churchley&rsquo;s
new life, they had been described in advance and were the
heroines of the occasion.&nbsp; There were so many ladies present
that this personage didn&rsquo;t talk to them much; she only
called them her &ldquo;chicks&rdquo; and asked them to hand about
tea-cups and bread and butter.&nbsp; All of which was highly
agreeable and indeed intensely exciting to Beatrice and Muriel,
who had little round red spots in <i>their</i> cheeks when they
came away.&nbsp; Adela quivered with the sense that her
mother&rsquo;s children were now Mrs. Churchley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;chicks&rdquo; and a part of the furniture of Mrs.
Churchley&rsquo;s dreadful consciousness.</p>
<p>It was one thing to have made up her mind, however; it was
another thing to make her attempt.&nbsp; It was when she learned
from Godfrey that the day was fixed, the 20th of July, only six
weeks removed, that she felt the importance of prompt
action.&nbsp; She learned everything from Godfrey now, having
decided it would be hypocrisy to question her father.&nbsp; Even
her silence was hypocritical, but she couldn&rsquo;t weep and
wail.&nbsp; Her father showed extreme tact; taking no notice of
her detachment, treating it as a moment of <i>bouderie</i> he was
bound to allow her and that would pout itself away.&nbsp; She
debated much as to whether she should take Godfrey into her
confidence; she would have done so without hesitation if he
hadn&rsquo;t disappointed her.&nbsp; He was so little what she
might have expected, and so perversely preoccupied that she could
explain it only by the high pressure at which he was living, his
anxiety about his &ldquo;exam.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was in a fidget,
in a fever, putting on a spurt to come in first; sceptical
moreover about his success and cynical about everything
else.&nbsp; He appeared to agree to the general axiom that they
didn&rsquo;t want a strange woman thrust into their life, but he
found Mrs. Churchley &ldquo;very jolly as a person to
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been to see her by himself&mdash;he had
been to see her three times.&nbsp; He in fact gave it out that he
would make the most of her now; he should probably be so little
in Seymour Street after these days.&nbsp; What Adela at last
determined to give him was her assurance that the marriage would
never take place.&nbsp; When he asked what she meant and who was
to prevent it she replied that the interesting couple would
abandon the idea of themselves, or that Mrs. Churchley at least
would after a week or two back out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be really horrid then,&rdquo; Godfrey
pronounced.&nbsp; &ldquo;The only respectable thing, at the point
they&rsquo;ve come to, is to put it through.&nbsp; Charming for
poor Dad to have the air of being
&lsquo;chucked&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made her hesitate two days more, but she found answers
more valid than any objections.&nbsp; The many-voiced answer to
everything&mdash;it was like the autumn wind round the
house&mdash;was the affront that fell back on her mother.&nbsp;
Her mother was dead but it killed her again.&nbsp; So one morning
at eleven o&rsquo;clock, when she knew her father was writing
letters, she went out quietly and, stopping the first hansom she
met, drove to Prince&rsquo;s Gate.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchley was at
home, and she was shown into the drawing-room with the request
that she would wait five minutes.&nbsp; She waited without the
sense of breaking down at the last, and the impulse to run away,
which were what she had expected to have.&nbsp; In the cab and at
the door her heart had beat terribly, but now suddenly, with the
game really to play, she found herself lucid and calm.&nbsp; It
was a joy to her to feel later that this was the way Mrs.
Churchley found her: not confused, not stammering nor
prevaricating, only a little amazed at her own courage, conscious
of the immense responsibility of her step and wonderfully older
than her years.&nbsp; Her hostess sounded her at first with
suspicious eyes, but eventually, to Adela&rsquo;s surprise, burst
into tears.&nbsp; At this the girl herself cried, and with the
secret happiness of believing they were saved.&nbsp; Mrs.
Churchley said she would think over what she had been told, and
she promised her young friend, freely enough and very firmly, not
to betray the secret of the latter&rsquo;s step to the
Colonel.&nbsp; They were saved&mdash;they were saved: the words
sung themselves in the girl&rsquo;s soul as she came
downstairs.&nbsp; When the door opened for her she saw her
brother on the step, and they looked at each other in surprise,
each finding it on the part of the other an odd hour for
Prince&rsquo;s Gate.&nbsp; Godfrey remarked that Mrs. Churchley
would have enough of the family, and Adela answered that she
would perhaps have too much.&nbsp; None the less the young man
went in while his sister took her way home.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">She</span> saw nothing of him for nearly a
week; he had more and more his own times and hours, adjusted to
his tremendous responsibilities, and he spent whole days at his
crammer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When she knocked at his door late in the
evening he was regularly not in his room.&nbsp; It was known in
the house how much he was worried; he was horribly nervous about
his ordeal.&nbsp; It was to begin on the 23rd of June, and his
father was as worried as himself.&nbsp; The wedding had been
arranged in relation to this; they wished poor Godfrey&rsquo;s
fate settled first, though they felt the nuptials would be
darkened if it shouldn&rsquo;t be settled right.</p>
<p>Ten days after that performance of her private undertaking
Adela began to sniff, as it were, a difference in the general
air; but as yet she was afraid to exult.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t in
truth a difference for the better, so that there might be still a
great tension.&nbsp; Her father, since the announcement of his
intended marriage, had been visibly pleased with himself, but
that pleasure now appeared to have undergone a check.&nbsp; She
had the impression known to the passengers on a great steamer
when, in the middle of the night, they feel the engines
stop.&nbsp; As this impression may easily sharpen to the sense
that something serious has happened, so the girl asked herself
what had actually occurred.&nbsp; She had expected something
serious; but it was as if she couldn&rsquo;t keep still in her
cabin&mdash;she wanted to go up and see.&nbsp; On the 20th, just
before breakfast, her maid brought her a message from her
brother.&nbsp; Mr. Godfrey would be obliged if she would speak to
him in his room.&nbsp; She went straight up to him, dreading to
find him ill, broken down on the eve of his formidable
week.&nbsp; This was not the case however&mdash;he rather seemed
already at work, to have been at work since dawn.&nbsp; But he
was very white and his eyes had a strange and new
expression.&nbsp; Her beautiful young brother looked older; he
looked haggard and hard.&nbsp; He met her there as if he had been
waiting for her, and he said at once: &ldquo;Please tell me this,
Adela&mdash;what was the purpose of your visit the other morning
to Mrs. Churchley, the day I met you at her door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared&mdash;she cast about.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
purpose?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; Why do you
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve put it off&mdash;they&rsquo;ve put it off
a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah thank God!&rdquo; said Adela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the devil do you thank God?&rdquo; Godfrey asked
with a strange impatience.</p>
<p>She gave a strained intense smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know I
think it all wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood looking at her up and down.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did you
do there?&nbsp; How did you interfere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you I interfered?&rdquo; she returned with a
deep flush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something&mdash;you did something.&nbsp; I
knew you had done it when I saw you come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I did was my own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn your own business!&rdquo; cried the young man.</p>
<p>She had never in her life been so spoken to, and in advance,
had she been given the choice, would have said that she&rsquo;d
rather die than be so handled by Godfrey.&nbsp; But her spirit
was high, and for a moment she was as angry as if she had been
cut with a whip.&nbsp; She escaped the blow but felt the
insult.&nbsp; &ldquo;And <i>your</i> business then?&rdquo; she
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wondered what that was when I saw
<i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood a moment longer scowling at her; then with the
exclamation &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a pretty mess!&rdquo; he
turned away from her and sat down to his books.</p>
<p>They had put it off, as he said; her father was dry and stiff
and official about it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose I had better let
you know we&rsquo;ve thought it best to postpone our marriage
till the end of the summer&mdash;Mrs. Churchley has so many
arrangements to make&rdquo;: he was not more expansive than
that.&nbsp; She neither knew nor greatly cared whether she but
vainly imagined or correctly observed him to watch her obliquely
for some measure of her receipt of these words.&nbsp; She
flattered herself that, thanks to Godfrey&rsquo;s forewarning,
cruel as the form of it had been, she was able to repress any
crude sign of elation.&nbsp; She had a perfectly good conscience,
for she could now judge what odious elements Mrs. Churchley, whom
she had not seen since the morning in Prince&rsquo;s Gate, had
already introduced into their dealings.&nbsp; She gathered
without difficulty that her father hadn&rsquo;t concurred in the
postponement, for he was more restless than before, more absent
and distinctly irritable.&nbsp; There was naturally still the
question of how much of this condition was to be attributed to
his solicitude about Godfrey.&nbsp; That young man took occasion
to say a horrible thing to his sister: &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t
pass it will be your fault.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were dreadful days
for the girl, and she asked herself how she could have borne them
if the hovering spirit of her mother hadn&rsquo;t been at her
side.&nbsp; Fortunately she always felt it there, sustaining,
commending, sanctifying.&nbsp; Suddenly her father announced to
her that he wished her to go immediately, with her sisters, down
to Brinton, where there was always part of a household and where
for a few weeks they would manage well enough.&nbsp; The only
explanation he gave of this desire was that he wanted them out of
the way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out of the way of what?&rdquo; she queried,
since there were to be for the time no preparations in Seymour
Street.&nbsp; She was willing to take it for out of the way of
his nerves.</p>
<p>She never needed urging however to go to Brinton, the dearest
old house in the world, where the happiest days of her young life
had been spent and the silent nearness of her mother always
seemed greatest.&nbsp; She was happy again, with Beatrice and
Muriel and Miss Flynn, with the air of summer and the haunted
rooms and her mother&rsquo;s garden and the talking oaks and the
nightingales.&nbsp; She wrote briefly to her father, giving him,
as he had requested, an account of things; and he wrote back that
since she was so contented&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t recognise
having told him that&mdash;she had better not return to town at
all.&nbsp; The fag-end of the London season would be unimportant
to her, and he was getting on very well.&nbsp; He mentioned that
Godfrey had passed his tests, but, as she knew, there would be a
tiresome wait before news of results.&nbsp; The poor chap was
going abroad for a month with young Sherard&mdash;he had earned a
little rest and a little fun.&nbsp; He went abroad without a word
to Adela, but in his beautiful little hand he took a chaffing
leave of Beatrice.&nbsp; The child showed her sister the letter,
of which she was very proud and which contained no message for
any one else.&nbsp; This was the worst bitterness of the whole
crisis for that somebody&mdash;its placing in so strange a light
the creature in the world whom, after her mother, she had loved
best.</p>
<p>Colonel Chart had said he would &ldquo;run down&rdquo; while
his children were at Brinton, but they heard no more about
it.&nbsp; He only wrote two or three times to Miss Flynn on
matters in regard to which Adela was surprised he shouldn&rsquo;t
have communicated with herself.&nbsp; Muriel accomplished an
upright little letter to Mrs. Churchley&mdash;her eldest sister
neither fostered nor discouraged the performance&mdash;to which
Mrs. Churchley replied, after a fortnight, in a meagre and, as
Adela thought, illiterate fashion, making no allusion to the
approach of any closer tie.&nbsp; Evidently the situation had
changed; the question of the marriage was dropped, at any rate
for the time.&nbsp; This idea gave our young woman a singular and
almost intoxicating sense of power; she felt as if she were
riding a great wave of confidence.&nbsp; She had decided and
acted&mdash;the greatest could do no more than that.&nbsp; The
grand thing was to see one&rsquo;s results, and what else was she
doing?&nbsp; These results were in big rich conspicuous lives;
the stage was large on which she moved her figures.&nbsp; Such a
vision was exciting, and as they had the use of a couple of
ponies at Brinton she worked off her excitement by a long
gallop.&nbsp; A day or two after this however came news of which
the effect was to rekindle it.&nbsp; Godfrey had come back, the
list had been published, he had passed first.&nbsp; These happy
tidings proceeded from the young man himself; he announced them
by a telegram to Beatrice, who had never in her life before
received such a missive and was proportionately inflated.&nbsp;
Adela reflected that she herself ought to have felt snubbed, but
she was too happy.&nbsp; They were free again, they were
themselves, the nightmare of the previous weeks was blown away,
the unity and dignity of her father&rsquo;s life restored, and,
to round off her sense of success, Godfrey had achieved his first
step toward high distinction.&nbsp; She wrote him the next day as
frankly and affectionately as if there had been no estrangement
between them, and besides telling him how she rejoiced in his
triumph begged him in charity to let them know exactly how the
case stood with regard to Mrs. Churchley.</p>
<p>Late in the summer afternoon she walked through the park to
the village with her letter, posted it and came back.&nbsp;
Suddenly, at one of the turns of the avenue, half-way to the
house, she saw a young man hover there as if awaiting her&mdash;a
young man who proved to be Godfrey on his pedestrian progress
over from the station.&nbsp; He had seen her as he took his short
cut, and if he had come down to Brinton it wasn&rsquo;t
apparently to avoid her.&nbsp; There was nevertheless none of the
joy of his triumph in his face as he came a very few steps to
meet her; and although, stiffly enough, he let her kiss him and
say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad&mdash;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; she
felt this tolerance as not quite the mere calm of the rising
diplomatist.&nbsp; He turned toward the house with her and walked
on a short distance while she uttered the hope that he had come
to stay some days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only till to-morrow morning.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
sending me straight to Madrid.&nbsp; I came down to say good-bye;
there&rsquo;s a fellow bringing my bags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Madrid?&nbsp; How awfully nice!&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s
awfully nice of you to have come,&rdquo; she said as she passed
her hand into his arm.</p>
<p>The movement made him stop, and, stopping, he turned on her in
a flash a face of something more than, suspicion&mdash;of
passionate reprobation.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I really came
for&mdash;you might as well know without more delay&mdash;is to
ask you a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A question?&rdquo;&mdash;she echoed it with a beating
heart.</p>
<p>They stood there under the old trees in the lingering light,
and, young and fine and fair as they both were, formed a complete
superficial harmony with the peaceful English scene.&nbsp; A near
view, however, would have shown that Godfrey Chart hadn&rsquo;t
taken so much trouble only to skim the surface.&nbsp; He looked
deep into his sister&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was it you
said that morning to Mrs. Churchley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fixed them on the ground a moment, but at last met his own
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she has told you, why do you
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has told me nothing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has broken it off.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;s
over.&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s in the depths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the depths?&rdquo; the girl quavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think it would make him jolly?&rdquo; he went
on.</p>
<p>She had to choose what to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get
over it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll he glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen.&nbsp; You interfered, you
invented something, you got round her.&nbsp; I insist on knowing
what you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adela felt that if it was a question of obstinacy there was
something within her she could count on; in spite of which, while
she stood looking down again a moment, she said to herself
&ldquo;I could be dumb and dogged if I chose, but I scorn to
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of what she had done,
but she wanted to be clear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you absolutely
certain it&rsquo;s broken off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, and she is; so that&rsquo;s as good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reason has she given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all&mdash;or half a dozen; it&rsquo;s the same
thing.&nbsp; She has changed her mind&mdash;she mistook her
feelings&mdash;she can&rsquo;t part with her independence.&nbsp;
Moreover he has too many children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you this?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Churchley told me.&nbsp; She has gone abroad for a
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she didn&rsquo;t tell you what I said to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godfrey showed an impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I take
this trouble if she had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have taken it to make me suffer,&rdquo; said
Adela.&nbsp; &ldquo;That appears to be what you want to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I leave that to you&mdash;it&rsquo;s the good turn
you&rsquo;ve done me!&rdquo; cried the young man with hot tears
in his eyes.</p>
<p>She stared, aghast with the perception that there was some
dreadful thing she didn&rsquo;t know; but he walked on, dropping
the question angrily and turning his back to her as if he
couldn&rsquo;t trust himself.&nbsp; She read his disgust in his
averted, face, in the way he squared his shoulders and smote the
ground with his stick, and she hurried after him and presently
overtook him.&nbsp; She kept by him for a moment in silence; then
she broke out: &ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; What in the world
have I done to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have helped me.&nbsp; She was all ready to
help me,&rdquo; Godfrey portentously said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helped you in what?&rdquo;&nbsp; She wondered what he
meant; if he had made debts that he was afraid to confess to his
father and&mdash;of all horrible things&mdash;had been looking to
Mrs. Churchley to pay.&nbsp; She turned red with the mere
apprehension of this and, on the heels of her guess, exulted
again at having perhaps averted such a shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just see I&rsquo;m in trouble?&nbsp;
Where are your eyes, your senses, your sympathy, that you talk so
much about?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you seen these six months that
I&rsquo;ve a curst worry in my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seized his arm, made him stop, stood looking up at him
like a frightened little girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter, Godfrey?&mdash;what <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone against me so&mdash;I could strangle
you!&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp; This image added nothing to her
dread; her dread was that he had done some wrong, was stained
with some guilt.&nbsp; She uttered it to him with clasped hands,
begging him to tell her the worst; but, still more passionately,
he cut her short with his own cry: &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name,
satisfy me!&nbsp; What infernal thing did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t infernal&mdash;it was right.&nbsp; I
told her mamma had been wretched,&rdquo; said Adela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretched?&nbsp; You told her such a lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the only way, and she believed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretched how?&mdash;wretched when?&mdash;wretched
where?&rdquo; the young man stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her papa had made her so, and that <i>she</i>
ought to know it.&nbsp; I told her the question troubled me
unspeakably, but that I had made up my mind it was my duty to
initiate her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Adela paused, the light of bravado in
her face, as if, though struck while the words came with the
monstrosity of what she had done, she was incapable of abating a
jot of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I notified her that he had faults and
peculiarities that made mamma&rsquo;s life a long worry&mdash;a
martyrdom that she hid wonderfully from the world, but that we
saw and that I had often pitied.&nbsp; I told her what they were,
these faults and peculiarities; I put the dots on the
i&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I said it wasn&rsquo;t fair to let another
person marry him without a warning.&nbsp; I warned her; I
satisfied my conscience.&nbsp; She could do as she liked.&nbsp;
My responsibility was over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godfrey gazed at her; he listened with parted lips,
incredulous and appalled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You invented such a tissue
of falsities and calumnies, and you talk about your
conscience?&nbsp; You stand there in your senses and proclaim
your crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have committed any crime that would have
rescued us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insult and blacken and ruin your own father?&rdquo;
Godfrey kept on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never know it; she took a vow she
wouldn&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;ll he damned if <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t tell
him!&rdquo; he rang out.</p>
<p>Adela felt sick at this, but she flamed up to resent the
treachery, as it struck her, of such a menace.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did
right&mdash;I did right!&rdquo; she vehemently declared &ldquo;I
went down on my knees to pray for guidance, and I saved
mamma&rsquo;s memory from outrage.&nbsp; But if I hadn&rsquo;t,
if I hadn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;she faltered an
instant&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worse than you, and I&rsquo;m
not so bad, for you&rsquo;ve done something that you&rsquo;re
ashamed to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had taken out his watch; he looked at it with quick
intensity, as if not hearing nor heeding her.&nbsp; Then, his
calculating eyes raised, he fixed her long enough to exclaim with
unsurpassable horror and contempt: &ldquo;You raving
maniac!&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned away from her; he bounded down the
avenue in the direction from which they had come, and, while she
watched him, strode away, across the grass, toward the short cut
to the station.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">His</span> bags, by the time she got home,
had been brought to the house, but Beatrice and Muriel,
immediately informed of this, waited for their brother in
vain.&nbsp; Their sister said nothing to them of her having seen
him, and she accepted after a little, with a calmness that
surprised herself, the idea that he had returned to town to
denounce her.&nbsp; She believed this would make no difference
now&mdash;she had done what she had done.&nbsp; She had somehow a
stiff faith in Mrs. Churchley.&nbsp; Once that so considerable
mass had received its impetus it wouldn&rsquo;t, it
couldn&rsquo;t pull up.&nbsp; It represented a heavy-footed
person, incapable of further agility.&nbsp; Adela recognised too
how well it might have come over her that there were too many
children.&nbsp; Lastly the girl fortified herself with the
reflexion, grotesque in the conditions and conducing to prove her
sense of humour not high, that her father was after all not a man
to be played with.&nbsp; It seemed to her at any rate that if she
<i>had</i> baffled his unholy purpose she could bear
anything&mdash;bear imprisonment and bread and water, bear lashes
and torture, bear even his lifelong reproach.&nbsp; What she
could bear least was the wonder of the inconvenience she had
inflicted on Godfrey.&nbsp; She had time to turn this over, very
vainly, for a succession of days&mdash;days more numerous than
she had expected, which passed without bringing her from London
any summons to come up and take her punishment.&nbsp; She sounded
the possible, she compared the degrees of the probable; feeling
however that as a cloistered girl she was poorly equipped for
speculation.&nbsp; She tried to imagine the calamitous things
young men might do, and could only feel that such things would
naturally be connected either with borrowed money or with bad
women.&nbsp; She became conscious that after all she knew almost
nothing about either of those interests.&nbsp; The worst woman
she knew was Mrs. Churchley herself.&nbsp; Meanwhile there was no
reverberation from Seymour Street&mdash;only a sultry
silence.</p>
<p>At Brinton she spent hours in her mother&rsquo;s garden, where
she had grown up, where she considered that she was training for
old age, since she meant not to depend on whist.&nbsp; She loved
the place as, had she been a good Catholic, she would have loved
the smell of her parish church; and indeed there was in her
passion for flowers something of the respect of a religion.&nbsp;
They seemed to her the only things in the world that really
respected themselves, unless one made an exception for Nutkins,
who had been in command all through her mother&rsquo;s time, with
whom she had had a real friendship and who had been affected by
their pure example.&nbsp; He was the person left in the world
with whom on the whole she could speak most intimately of the
dead.&nbsp; They never had to name her together&mdash;they only
said &ldquo;she&rdquo;; and Nutkins freely conceded that she had
taught him everything he knew.&nbsp; When Beatrice and Muriel
said &ldquo;she&rdquo; they referred to Mrs. Churchley.&nbsp;
Adela had reason to believe she should never marry, and that some
day she should have about a thousand a year.&nbsp; This made her
see in the far future a little garden of her own, under a hill,
full of rare and exquisite things, where she would spend most of
her old age on her knees with an apron and stout gloves, with a
pair of shears and a trowel, steeped in the comfort of being
thought mad.</p>
<p>One morning ten days after her scene with Godfrey, on coming
back into the house shortly before lunch, she was met by Miss
Flynn with the notification that a lady in the drawing-room had
been waiting for her for some minutes.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lady&rdquo;
suggested immediately Mrs. Churchley.&nbsp; It came over Adela
that the form in which her penalty was to descend would be a
personal explanation with that misdirected woman.&nbsp; The lady
had given no name, and Miss Flynn hadn&rsquo;t seen Mrs.
Churchley; nevertheless the governess was certain Adela&rsquo;s
surmise was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she big and dreadful?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>
<p>Miss Flynn, who was circumspection itself, took her
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dreadful, but she&rsquo;s not
big.&rdquo;&nbsp; She added that she wasn&rsquo;t sure she ought
to let Adela go in alone; but this young lady took herself
throughout for a heroine, and it wasn&rsquo;t in a heroine to
shrink from any encounter.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t she every instant
in transcendent contact with her mother?&nbsp; The visitor might
have no connexion whatever with the drama of her father&rsquo;s
frustrated marriage; but everything to-day for Adela was part of
that.</p>
<p>Miss Flynn&rsquo;s description had prepared her for a
considerable shock, but she wasn&rsquo;t agitated by her first
glimpse of the person who awaited her.&nbsp; A youngish
well-dressed woman stood there, and silence was between them
while they looked at each other.&nbsp; Before either had spoken
however Adela began to see what Miss Flynn had intended.&nbsp; In
the light of the drawing-room window the lady was five-and-thirty
years of age and had vivid yellow hair.&nbsp; She also had a blue
cloth suit with brass buttons, a stick-up collar like a
gentleman&rsquo;s, a necktie arranged in a sailor&rsquo;s knot, a
golden pin in the shape of a little lawn-tennis racket, and
pearl-grey gloves with big black stitchings.&nbsp; Adela&rsquo;s
second impression was that she was an actress, and her third that
no such person had ever before crossed that threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve come for,&rdquo;
said the apparition.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask you to
intercede.&rdquo;&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t an actress; an actress
would have had a nicer voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To intercede?&rdquo;&nbsp; Adela was too bewildered to
ask her to sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your father, you know.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t
know, but he&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her
&ldquo;have&rdquo; sounded like &ldquo;&rsquo;ave.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She explained, with many more such sounds, that she was Mrs.
Godfrey, that they had been married seven mortal months.&nbsp; If
Godfrey was going abroad she must go with him, and the only way
she could go with him would be for his father to do
something.&nbsp; He was afraid of his father&mdash;that was
clear; he was afraid even to tell him.&nbsp; What she had come
down for was to see some other member of the family face to
face&mdash;&ldquo;fice to fice,&rdquo; Mrs. Godfrey called
it&mdash;and try if he couldn&rsquo;t be approached by another
side.&nbsp; If no one else would act then she would just have to
act herself.&nbsp; The Colonel would have to do
something&mdash;that was the only way out of it.</p>
<p>What really happened Adela never quite understood; what seemed
to be happening was that the room went round and round.&nbsp;
Through the blur of perception accompanying this effect the sharp
stabs of her visitor&rsquo;s revelation came to her like the
words heard by a patient &ldquo;going off&rdquo; under
ether.&nbsp; She afterwards denied passionately even to herself
that she had done anything so abject as to faint; but there was a
lapse in her consciousness on the score of Miss Flynn&rsquo;s
intervention.&nbsp; This intervention had evidently been active,
for when they talked the matter over, later in the day, with
bated breath and infinite dissimulation for the school-room
quarter, the governess had more lurid truths, and still more, to
impart than to receive.&nbsp; She was at any rate under the
impression that she had athletically contended, in the
drawing-room, with the yellow hair&mdash;this after removing
Adela from the scene and before inducing Mrs. Godfrey to
withdraw.&nbsp; Miss Flynn had never known a more thrilling day,
for all the rest of it too was pervaded with agitations and
conversations, precautions and alarms.&nbsp; It was given out to
Beatrice and Muriel that their sister had been taken suddenly
ill, and the governess ministered to her in her room.&nbsp;
Indeed Adela had never found herself less at ease, for this time
she had received a blow that she couldn&rsquo;t return.&nbsp;
There was nothing to do but to take it, to endure the humiliation
of her wound.</p>
<p>At first she declined to take it&mdash;having, as might
appear, the much more attractive resource of regarding her
visitant as a mere masquerading person, an impudent
impostor.&nbsp; On the face of the matter moreover it
wasn&rsquo;t fair to believe till one heard; and to hear in such
a case was to hear Godfrey himself.&nbsp; Whatever she had tried
to imagine about him she hadn&rsquo;t arrived at anything so
belittling as an idiotic secret marriage with a dyed and painted
hag.&nbsp; Adela repeated this last word as if it gave her
comfort; and indeed where everything was so bad fifteen years of
seniority made the case little worse.&nbsp; Miss Flynn was
portentous, for Miss Flynn had had it out with the wretch.&nbsp;
She had cross-questioned her and had not broken her down.&nbsp;
This was the most uplifted hour of Miss Flynn&rsquo;s life; for
whereas she usually had to content herself with being humbly and
gloomily in the right she could now be magnanimously and showily
so.&nbsp; Her only perplexity was as to what she ought to
do&mdash;write to Colonel Chart or go up to town to see
him.&nbsp; She bloomed with alternatives&mdash;she resembled some
dull garden-path which under a copious downpour has begun to
flaunt with colour.&nbsp; Toward evening Adela was obliged to
recognise that her brother&rsquo;s worry, of which he had spoken
to her, had appeared bad enough to consist even of a low wife,
and to remember that, so far from its being inconceivable a young
man in his position should clandestinely take one, she had been
present, years before, during her mother&rsquo;s lifetime, when
Lady Molesley declared gaily, over a cup of tea, that this was
precisely what she expected of her eldest son.&nbsp; The next
morning it was the worst possibilities that seemed clearest; the
only thing left with a tatter of dusky comfort being the
ambiguity of Godfrey&rsquo;s charge that her own action had
&ldquo;done&rdquo; for him.&nbsp; That was a matter by itself,
and she racked her brains for a connecting link between Mrs.
Churchley and Mrs. Godfrey.&nbsp; At last she made up her mind
that they were related by blood; very likely, though differing in
fortune, they were cousins or even sisters.&nbsp; But even then
what did the wretched boy mean?</p>
<p>Arrested by the unnatural fascination of opportunity, Miss
Flynn received before lunch a telegram from Colonel
Chart&mdash;an order for dinner and a vehicle; he and Godfrey
were to arrive at six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Adela had plenty of
occupation for the interval, since she was pitying her father
when she wasn&rsquo;t rejoicing that her mother had gone too soon
to know.&nbsp; She flattered herself she made out the
providential reason of that cruelty now.&nbsp; She found time
however still to wonder for what purpose, given the situation,
Godfrey was to be brought down.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t
unconscious indeed that she had little general knowledge of what
usually was done with young men in that predicament.&nbsp; One
talked about the situation, but the situation was an abyss.&nbsp;
She felt this still more when she found, on her father&rsquo;s
arrival, that nothing apparently was to happen as she had taken
for granted it would.&nbsp; There was an inviolable hush over the
whole affair, but no tragedy, no publicity, nothing ugly.&nbsp;
The tragedy had been in town&mdash;the faces of the two men spoke
of it in spite of their other perfunctory aspects; and at present
there was only a family dinner, with Beatrice and Muriel and the
governess&mdash;with almost a company tone too, the result of the
desire to avoid publicity.&nbsp; Adela admired her father; she
knew what he was feeling if Mrs. Godfrey had been at him, and yet
she saw him positively gallant.&nbsp; He was mildly austere, or
rather even&mdash;what was it?&mdash;august; just as, coldly
equivocal, he never looked at his son, so that at moments he
struck her as almost sick with sadness.&nbsp; Godfrey was equally
inscrutable and therefore wholly different from what he had been
as he stood before her in the park.&nbsp; If he was to start on
his career (with such a wife!&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t she utterly
blight it?) he was already professional enough to know how to
wear a mask.</p>
<p>Before they rose from table she felt herself wholly
bewildered, so little were such large causes traceable in their
effects.&nbsp; She had nerved herself for a great ordeal, but the
air was as sweet as an anodyne.&nbsp; It was perfectly plain to
her that her father was deadly sore&mdash;as pathetic as a person
betrayed.&nbsp; He was broken, but he showed no resentment; there
was a weight on his heart, but he had lightened it by dressing as
immaculately as usual for dinner.&nbsp; She asked herself what
immensity of a row there could have been in town to have left his
anger so spent.&nbsp; He went through everything, even to sitting
with his son after dinner.&nbsp; When they came out together he
invited Beatrice and Muriel to the billiard-room, and as Miss
Flynn discreetly withdrew Adela was left alone with Godfrey, who
was completely changed and not now in the least of a rage.&nbsp;
He was broken too, but not so pathetic as his father.&nbsp; He
was only very correct and apologetic he said to his sister:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry <i>you</i> were annoyed&mdash;it
was something I never dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t think immediately what he meant; then she
grasped the reference to her extraordinary invader.&nbsp; She was
uncertain, however, what tone to take; perhaps his father had
arranged with him that they were to make the best of it.&nbsp;
But she spoke her own despair in the way she murmured &ldquo;Oh
Godfrey, Godfrey, is it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been the most unutterable donkey&mdash;you
can say what you like to me.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t say anything
worse than I&rsquo;ve said to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, my brother!&rdquo;&mdash;his words made her
wail it out.&nbsp; He hushed her with a movement and she asked:
&ldquo;What has father said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked very high over her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
give her six hundred a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah the angel!&rdquo;&mdash;it was too splendid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On condition&rdquo;&mdash;Godfrey scarce
blinked&mdash;&ldquo;she never comes near me.&nbsp; She has
solemnly promised, and she&rsquo;ll probably leave me alone to
get the money.&nbsp; If she doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;in
diplomacy&mdash;I&rsquo;m lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been turning
his eyes vaguely about, this way and that, to avoid meeting hers;
but after another instant he gave up the effort and she had the
miserable confession of his glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
living in hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, my brother!&rdquo; she yearningly
repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an idiot; yet for her I&rsquo;ve behaved
like one.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; It was all done in a day, and since then fancy my
condition; fancy my work in such a torment; fancy my coming
through at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God you passed!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have shot myself if I hadn&rsquo;t
been.&nbsp; I had an awful day yesterday with the governor; it
was late at night before it was over.&nbsp; I leave England next
week.&nbsp; He brought me down here for it to look well&mdash;so
that the children shan&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> wonderful too!&rdquo; Adela
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful too!&rdquo; Godfrey echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did <i>she</i> tell him?&rdquo; the girl went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came straight to Seymour Street from here.&nbsp;
She saw him alone first; then he called me in.&nbsp; <i>That</i>
luxury lasted about an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor father!&rdquo; Adela moaned at this; on
which her brother remained silent.&nbsp; Then after he had
alluded to it as the scene he had lived in terror of all through
his cramming, and she had sighed forth again her pity and
admiration for such a mixture of anxieties and such a triumph of
talent, she pursued: &ldquo;Have you told him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told him what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you said you would&mdash;what <i>I</i>
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godfrey turned away as if at present he had very little
interest in that inferior tribulation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was angry
with you, but I cooled off.&nbsp; I held my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clasped her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;You thought of
mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t speak of mamma!&rdquo; he cried as in
rueful tenderness.</p>
<p>It was indeed not a happy moment, and she murmured: &ldquo;No;
if you <i>had</i> thought of her&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made Godfrey face her again with a small flare in his
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh <i>then</i> it didn&rsquo;t prevent.&nbsp;
I thought that woman really good.&nbsp; I believed in
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she <i>very</i> bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never mention her to you again,&rdquo; he
returned with dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may believe <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t speak of
her!&nbsp; So father doesn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; the girl
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t know what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I said what I did to Mrs. Churchley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a momentary pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,
but you must find out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall find out,&rdquo; said Adela.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what had Mrs. Churchley to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With <i>my</i> misery?&nbsp; I told her.&nbsp; I had to
tell some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appeared&mdash;though but after an instant&mdash;to know
exactly why.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh you take things so beastly
hard&mdash;you make such rows.&rdquo;&nbsp; Adela covered her
face with her hands and he went on: &ldquo;What I wanted was
comfort&mdash;not to be lashed up.&nbsp; I thought I should go
mad.&nbsp; I wanted Mrs. Churchley to break it to father, to
intercede for me and help him to meet it.&nbsp; She was awfully
kind to me, she listened and she understood; she could fancy how
it had happened.&nbsp; Without her I shouldn&rsquo;t have pulled
through.&nbsp; She liked me, you know,&rdquo; he further
explained, and as if it were quite worth mentioning&mdash;all the
more that it was pleasant to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;She said
she&rsquo;d do what she could for me.&nbsp; She was full of
sympathy and resource.&nbsp; I really leaned on her.&nbsp; But
when <i>you</i> cut in of course it spoiled everything.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s why I was so furious with you.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t do anything then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adela dropped her hands, staring; she felt she had walked in
darkness.&nbsp; &ldquo;So that he had to meet it
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dame</i>!&rdquo; said Godfrey, who had got up his
French tremendously.</p>
<p>Muriel came to the door to say papa wished the two others to
join them, and the next day Godfrey returned to town.&nbsp; His
father remained at Brinton, without an intermission, the rest of
the summer and the whole of the autumn, and Adela had a chance to
find out, as she had said, whether he knew she had
interfered.&nbsp; But in spite of her chance she never found
out.&nbsp; He knew Mrs. Churchley had thrown him over and he knew
his daughter rejoiced in it, but he appeared not to have divined
the relation between the two facts.&nbsp; It was strange that one
of the matters he was clearest about&mdash;Adela&rsquo;s secret
triumph&mdash;should have been just the thing which from this
time on justified less and less such a confidence.&nbsp; She was
too sorry for him to be consistently glad.&nbsp; She watched his
attempts to wind himself up on the subject of shorthorns and
drainage, and she favoured to the utmost of her ability his
intermittent disposition to make a figure in orchids.&nbsp; She
wondered whether they mightn&rsquo;t have a few people at
Brinton; but when she mentioned the idea he asked what in the
world there would be to attract them.&nbsp; It was a confoundedly
stupid house, he remarked&mdash;with all respect to <i>her</i>
cleverness.&nbsp; Beatrice and Muriel were mystified; the
prospect of going out immensely had faded so utterly away.&nbsp;
They were apparently not to go out at all.&nbsp; Colonel Chart
was aimless and bored; he paced up and down and went back to
smoking, which was bad for him, and looked drearily out of
windows as if on the bare chance that something might
arrive.&nbsp; Did he expect Mrs. Churchley to arrive, did he
expect her to relent on finding she couldn&rsquo;t live without
him?&nbsp; It was Adela&rsquo;s belief that she gave no
sign.&nbsp; But the girl thought it really remarkable of her not
to have betrayed her ingenious young visitor.&nbsp; Adela&rsquo;s
judgement of human nature was perhaps harsh, but she believed
that most women, given the various facts, wouldn&rsquo;t have
been so forbearing.&nbsp; This lady&rsquo;s conception of the
point of honour placed her there in a finer and purer light than
had at all originally promised to shine about her.</p>
<p>She meanwhile herself could well judge how heavy her father
found the burden of Godfrey&rsquo;s folly and how he was
incommoded at having to pay the horrible woman six hundred a
year.&nbsp; Doubtless he was having dreadful letters from her;
doubtless she threatened them all with hideous exposure.&nbsp; If
the matter should be bruited Godfrey&rsquo;s prospects would
collapse on the spot.&nbsp; He thought Madrid very charming and
curious, but Mrs. Godfrey was in England, so that his father had
to face the music.&nbsp; Adela took a dolorous comfort in her
mother&rsquo;s being out of that&mdash;it would have killed her;
but this didn&rsquo;t blind her to the fact that the comfort for
her father would perhaps have been greater if he had had some one
to talk to about his trouble.&nbsp; He never dreamed of doing so
to her, and she felt she couldn&rsquo;t ask him.&nbsp; In the
family life he wanted utter silence about it.&nbsp; Early in the
winter he went abroad for ten weeks, leaving her with her sisters
in the country, where it was not to be denied that at this time
existence had very little savour.&nbsp; She half expected her
sister-in-law would again descend on her; but the fear
wasn&rsquo;t justified, and the quietude of the awful creature
seemed really to vibrate with the ring of gold-pieces.&nbsp;
There were sure to be extras.&nbsp; Adela winced at the
extras.&nbsp; Colonel Chart went to Paris and to Monte Carlo and
then to Madrid to see his boy.&nbsp; His daughter had the vision
of his perhaps meeting Mrs. Churchley somewhere, since, if she
had gone for a year, she would still be on the Continent.&nbsp;
If he should meet her perhaps the affair would come on again: she
caught herself musing over this.&nbsp; But he brought back no
such appearance, and, seeing him after an interval, she was
struck afresh with his jilted and wasted air.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t like it&mdash;she resented it.&nbsp; A little more
and she would have said that that was no way to treat so faithful
a man.</p>
<p>They all went up to town in March, and on one of the first
days of April she saw Mrs. Churchley in the Park.&nbsp; She
herself remained apparently invisible to that lady&mdash;she
herself and Beatrice and Muriel, who sat with her in their
mother&rsquo;s old bottle-green landau.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchley,
perched higher than ever, rode by without a recognition; but this
didn&rsquo;t prevent Adela&rsquo;s going to her before the month
was over.&nbsp; As on her great previous occasion she went in the
morning, and she again had the good fortune to be admitted.&nbsp;
This time, however, her visit was shorter, and a week after
making it&mdash;the week was a desolation&mdash;she addressed to
her brother at Madrid a letter containing these words: &ldquo;I
could endure it no longer&mdash;I confessed and retracted; I
explained to her as well as I could the falsity of what I said to
her ten months ago and the benighted purity of my motives for
saying it.&nbsp; I besought her to regard it as unsaid, to
forgive me, not to despise me too much, to take pity on poor
<i>perfect</i> papa and come back to him.&nbsp; She was more
good-natured than you might have expected&mdash;indeed she
laughed extravagantly.&nbsp; She had never believed me&mdash;it
was too absurd; she had only, at the time, disliked me.&nbsp; She
found me utterly false&mdash;she was very frank with me about
this&mdash;and she told papa she really thought me horrid.&nbsp;
She said she could never live with such a girl, and as I would
certainly never marry I must be sent away&mdash;in short she

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
